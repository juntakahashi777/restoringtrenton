Retoring Trenton - Vacant Property Visualization Project

Vacant and abandoned properties are known to be a harmful presence in communities. Trenton unfortunately has over 6,000 abandoned lots and buildings, constituting ~20% of the city. This project has been developed in order to better visualize the vacant property data gathered by the non-profit organization Isles, Inc. as well as provide a tool for interacting with the data.

The development version of this project is hosted at http://restoringtrentoniw.appspot.com/, and the live version of the project is on the Isles website at http://www.restoringtrenton.org/#!map/mainPage. Also, there are images of the working development version under /images/ in this repository. 

This project has been developed by Junya Takahashi under the supervision of Iana Dikidjieva of Isles Inc, and Dr. Alan Kaplan of Princeton University.
